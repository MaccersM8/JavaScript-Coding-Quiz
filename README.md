# JavaScript Code Quiz

## Description
The motivation behind this challenge was to create a quiz game using JavaScript which replicated what many developers face by way of being asked to complete a coding assessment. The parameters of this challenge were as follows:
- When the user clicks the "Start" button a series of questions appear.
- Each possible answer to each question must be a button that can be clicked. When this action occurs, the program presents the user with a new question to answer.
- If an incorrect answer is clicked, then time is deducted from the timer.
- The quiz ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
- When the game ends, the program should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score.

Throughout working on this challenge, I have learnt the following:
- How to navigate and manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Reinforced my knowledge and capabilities to implement JavaScript functions.
- How to store and retrieve data from local (client side) storage.

Once you have clicked this button, you as the user will be presented with a series of questions one at a time to answer within a 75 second timeframe. An example of a question can be seen below:

If you as the user selects a correct answer, you will be informed of this by some written feedback on screen and a sound effect:

If you as the user selects an incorrect answer, you will be informed of this by some written feedback on screen and a sound effect:

When you as the user completes the game, you will be presented with your score and the opportunity to enter your intials so that your score can be saved:

When the "Submit" button is clicked, you as the user will be taken to the "HighScores" page where both the initials and score can be seen:

The user can then either click the "Go Back" button and have another try or alternatively clear the scores saved by clicking the "Clear Highscores" button.
